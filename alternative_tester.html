One day we walked down to the beach and meandered among the smooth stones, here we built a rock tower.  In this image the wet balanced stones seem to add to the deep mystique of the place."

The turning and rushing of the frothy water is like watching a battle or a dance, it feels like an etherial illusion."

We were so fortunate to have been able to stay at this Marae with the amazing people to whom it belongs because it is the sacred space of their ancestors.  The empty shoes in this picture represent a lesson they taught us; that the spirits of our ancestors are always with us."

It felt impossible.  We were so overcome that we stopped and fell to the ground drinking in everything with our eyes until we felt fulfilled, grounded, connected."

We stopped and looked around and realized it was something out of a fairy tail.  The sweet wild roses, the meadow of daisies, and the solemn misty mountains in the distance."
